# Music Recommendation App
This is a web application that provides users with a playlist of recommended songs based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## How it Works
The UI allows users to input a string.
When the user submits the string, a POST request is sent to the back-end server.
The back-end server processes the string using NLP techniques to identify possible music types or song names, based on the processed output from the NLP, the app uses an appropriate music-related API or database to retrieve song recommendations or playlists.
The song recommendations or playlist are returned as a JSON response to the front-end user interface.
The song recommendations or playlist are displayed to the user on the front-end user interface.
## Technologies Used
Front-end: React - MUI (React component library)
Sending POST requests: fetch
Back-end server: Node.js with Express framework
NLP processing: Natural or SpaCy library
Music-related API or database: Spotify, Last.fm, or Pandora API, or MusicBrainz or Discogs database

It is true that the user interface (UI) for a web application does not necessarily need to be very complicated or resource-intensive. However, 
even a relatively simple UI can still benefit from the use of modern frameworks and libraries like React and Node.js/Express, 
which can provide a more efficient and scalable development experience.
